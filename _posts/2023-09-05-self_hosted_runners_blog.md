## Introduction

In this post, co-authored with Veeraveni Ajay, I'll provide an overview of configuring self-hosted runners with GitHub Actions. This is part of my exploration in software engineering, leveraging tools to streamline CI/CD processes and scale application deployments effectively.

## Why Self-Hosted Runners?

We chose self-hosted runners to gain more control over our CI/CD environment, ensuring consistency with our production setup and improving cost efficiency for large-scale operations.

## Tech Stack

To achieve this setup, we used:

- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):** To manage our Kubernetes environment.
- **GitHub Actions:** For defining and running CI/CD workflows.
- **Docker:** For containerizing our applications and runners.
- **Terraform:** For infrastructure as code, enabling us to provision and manage cloud resources efficiently.

## Streamlining CI/CD

By leveraging these tools, we were able to:

- **Improve Consistency:** Ensure our CI/CD environment closely matched our production environment, reducing deployment issues.
- **Enhance Scalability:** Easily scale our runner capacity by adding nodes to our Kubernetes cluster.
- **Increase Cost Efficiency:** Reduce costs by using our own infrastructure instead of relying solely on GitHub-hosted runners.

## Conclusion

Configuring self-hosted runners with GitHub Actions allowed us to streamline our CI/CD pipeline, making it more efficient and scalable. This setup is a testament to how we can use modern tools to optimize application deployments.
